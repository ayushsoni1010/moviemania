## Introduction 📸

Welcome to MovieMania, where the world of cinema comes to life on your screen! Our movie app empowers you to explore the latest movies and actors effortlessly, all thanks to the powerful TMDB API, React, and styled-components. Whether you're a film buff or just looking for a good flick, MovieMania is your ultimate cinematic companion.

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with MovieMania, follow the installation and usage instructions below.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayushsoni1010/moviemania.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd moviemania
```
3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```
4. Configure the environment variables, if necessary.
5. Start the development server:
```bash
yarn start
```
6. Open your favorite web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to explore MovieMania.\
   The page will automatically reload when you make changes, and you can check the console for any lint errors or development insights.

## Available Scripts 🎬

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

1. Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
```bash
yarn start
```

2. Run the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more information on running tests, check the [Create React App documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/).
```bash
yarn test
```

3. Builds the app for production, optimizing its performance and generating files in the build folder. Your app is now ready for deployment.
```bash
yarn build
```

4. If you're not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will copy all configuration files and dependencies into your project, giving you full control over them. Most commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts for you to customize as needed.\
  \
  Remember, you don't have to use eject if the default configuration meets your needs.
```bash
yarn eject
```
`Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!`

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
