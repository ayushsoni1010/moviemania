## Getting Started üöÄ

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd moviemania
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

yarn install
```

4. Configure the environment variables, if necessary.

   The page will automatically reload when you make changes, and you can check the console for any lint errors or development insights.

## Available Scripts üé¨

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

1. Runs the app in the development mode.\
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

```bash
yarn start
```

2. Run the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more information on running tests, check the [Create React App documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/).

```

4. If you're not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will copy all configuration files and dependencies into your project, giving you full control over them. Most commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts for you to customize as needed.\
   \
   Remember, you don't have to use eject if the default configuration meets your needs.

```bash
yarn eject
```

`Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!`
